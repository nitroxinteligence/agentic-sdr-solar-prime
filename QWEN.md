## Qwen Added Memories
- I've completed a comprehensive analysis of the SDR IA SolarPrime system, identifying critical issues with follow-ups, scheduling, and CRM integration. I've created four detailed documentation files: ANALISE_COMPLETA_SISTEMA.md, DIAGNOSTICO_COMPLETO_SISTEMA.md, PLANO_IMPLEMENTACAO.md, and RELATORIO_TECNICO_DETALHADO.md. These documents outline the problems, propose specific solutions, and provide an implementation plan. I've also committed these changes to the git repository.
- I've implemented major improvements to the SDR IA SolarPrime system:
1. Refactored AgenticSDR to call services directly without TeamCoordinator
2. Fixed follow-up executor to use Redis locks and sequential scheduling
3. Improved calendar service with real availability checking
4. Updated CRM service with unified stage mapping
These changes address the critical issues identified in our analysis and simplify the architecture.
