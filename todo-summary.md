# Summary of Main Issues and Recommendations

## 1. Critical Issues

### 1.1. Race Conditions in Calendar Service
- **Issue**: No locks are implemented for critical calendar operations, which could lead to double bookings in high-concurrency scenarios.
- **Recommendation**: Implement Redis-based distributed locks for all calendar scheduling operations, following the pattern used in `FollowUpExecutorService`.

### 1.2. Data Consistency in Re-scheduling
- **Issue**: If the creation of a new event fails after canceling the old one in `reschedule_meeting`, the system enters an inconsistent state.
- **Recommendation**: Implement a rollback mechanism or retry strategy that attempts to recreate the original event if the new one fails.

### 1.3. Lack of Transactional Operations in CRM
- **Issue**: Operations that should be atomic (like updating a lead and adding a note) are not transactional, which could lead to data inconsistencies.
- **Recommendation**: Implement a compensation mechanism that undoes previous operations if a subsequent operation fails.

## 2. High Priority Improvements

### 2.1. Spam Prevention in Follow-ups
- **Issue**: There's no mechanism to limit the number of follow-ups sent to a lead in a given time period.
- **Recommendation**: Implement a rate-limiting mechanism for follow-ups per lead, with a default limit of 3 per week unless reset by user interaction. **(A GRANDE RECOMENDAÇAO AQUI É TER DOIS FOLLOW-UPS DE REENGAJAMENTO: 30min APÓS O LEAD PARAR DE RESPONDER E 24h SE O LEAD NAO RESPONDER AO PRIMEIRO FOLLOW-UP, CASO O LEAD NAO RESPONDA A NENHUM DOS FOLLOW-UPS, MOVE O CARD DO LEAD PARA O ESTÁGIO "NÃO INTERESSADO" NO KOMMOCRM, APENAS ISSO E O FOLLOW-UP DE LEMBRETE É QUANDO O AGENTE AGENDA UMA REUNIAO COM O LEAD, O CARD DO LEAD NO KOMMOCRM É MOVIDO PARA O ESTÁGIO "REUNIÃO AGENDADA", NISSO O AGENTE FAZ O LEMBRETE DE 24H ANTES DA REUNIAO E 2H ANTES DA REUNIAO, APENAS ISSO!)**

### 2.2. Error Handling Centralization
- **Issue**: Error handling is scattered throughout the codebase, making it difficult to maintain consistency.
- **Recommendation**: Centralize error handling with specific handlers for common error types (network errors, Google API errors, Kommo API errors).

## 3. Medium Priority Improvements

### 3.1. Database Performance
- **Issue**: Queries for pending follow-ups might be inefficient without proper indexing.
- **Recommendation**: Add an index on the `scheduled_at` column in the `follow_ups` table to improve query performance.

### 3.2. Context Transfer for Human Handoff
- **Issue**: When a lead is handed off to a human agent, there's no automatic summary of the conversation context sent to the CRM.
- **Recommendation**: Implement an automatic note creation in Kommo when a handoff occurs, summarizing the conversation context.

### 3.3. Security Enhancements
- **Issue**: While secrets are managed properly, there's no automatic token rotation or rigorous input validation.
- **Recommendation**: Implement automatic token rotation for Google Calendar and Kommo CRM, and add more rigorous input validation for webhook data.

## 4. Low Priority Improvements

### 4.1. Documentation
- **Issue**: Some functions and classes lack detailed docstrings.
- **Recommendation**: Add comprehensive docstrings explaining the purpose, parameters, and return values of all functions and classes.

### 4.2. Testing
- **Issue**: There's a lack of unit and integration tests, especially for critical services.
- **Recommendation**: Implement comprehensive unit and integration tests for `CalendarServiceReal`, `CRMServiceReal`, and `FollowUpServiceReal`, with specific tests for concurrency and error handling scenarios.

### 4.3. Monitoring
- **Issue**: There's no metrics collection or alerting system in place.
- **Recommendation**: Implement metrics collection and alerting to monitor service health and performance.
